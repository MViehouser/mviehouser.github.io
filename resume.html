				<h2>Aspiration for Future Goals</h2>

				<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
					<p>I am interested in Nonverbal communication and how people communicate without words, but through gestures. I also am very interested in how different cultures communicate and how language and specifically accent can affect their communication. Another interests of mine is how people establish and negotiate their identity in the social realm. I am very intigued by Erving Goffman and his work on stigma and deviants of society. This has lead me to working on a thesis which looks at a criminal identity and how it is used to fool and/or cover their criminal activities.</p>
