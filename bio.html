				<p>I moved to Spokane, Washington when I was 3. I have moved multiple times around Spokane but have remained in the general area. I was homeschooled through junior high and then received my GED at the age of 16. After receiving my GED I attended Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC) and received my Associate of Arts and Certificate for Sign Language Interpreting. I graduated from SFCC and have now attended Eastern Washington University for over a year now. My desire is to become a missionary working over in Europe and Russia. I have been to Russia twice and the Czech Republic once and taught English to college students.</p>
